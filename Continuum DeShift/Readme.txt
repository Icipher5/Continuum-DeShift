Continuum DeShift v1.0

Continuum DeShift is a program to extract and create the pac files used in the BlazBlue games for Windows.

Notes: 
Be careful! This program will overwrite files with the same name without asking when extracting.
If you have either of the explorer options enabled in the settings and change the location of the executable, you will have to disable the settings and re-enable them to get them working again.
Some pac files, the ones in Data/gr, have an extra byte set in the header. I don't know what this identifies as, but if you want to set that byte then just make sure the check box labled GR is checked in the create window.

Requirements:
.NET Framework 3.5
